basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth

This coding assignment was incredibly challenging for me. I had never attempted coding before or anything like it. I struggled alot with padding and margin space. I think that I was thinking too much into it at first and not realizing that the computer is only translating code very simply and does not understand what I want it to do without being very very specifically told in it's own language. I think I get to into thinking about why and reason instead of just understanding with code it just is what it is.

 I think I definatly need some work with calling out particular items as well as section areas. With regards to section areas, I would like to figure out how to have many different areas and then call them out in my grid css. I need a better understanding of padding and I think what made this very difficult for me is understanding when to use which and whether or not we need each space designation all the time. I could definatly do more research into placing a background image and also steps to take to be sure that the image is size appropriate for the web page I am preparing it for. All in all I think I have learned alot but I am comprehending it slowly and steadlily so I could use much more practice and I believe this will better my coding skills.
