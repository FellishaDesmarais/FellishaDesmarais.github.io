basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth

This coding assignment was incredibly challenging for me. I had never attempted coding before or anything like it. I struggled alot with padding and margin space. I think that I was thinking too much into it at first and not realizing that the computer is only translating code very simply and does not understand what I want it to do without being very very specifically told in it's own language. I think I get to into thinking about why and reason instead of just understanding with code it just is what it is.

 I feel really proud of where I have come with my portfolio site. I would like to keep up with updating this site as my work progresses and also utilize new coding skills that I would like to research further into and incorporate into my site.
